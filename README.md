# `cmake-init` - The missing CMake project initializer

Opinionated CMake project initializer to generate CMake projects that are
FetchContent ready, separate consumer and developer targets, provide install
rules with proper relocatable CMake packages and use modern CMake (3.14+)

See the gif in the [assets](assets) folder for an example of using
`cmake-init`.

Here are some example outputs of the script as of 0.2.4:

* https://github.com/friendlyanon/cmake-init-shared-static
* https://github.com/friendlyanon/cmake-init-executable
* https://github.com/friendlyanon/cmake-init-header-only

## Goals

* Be simple to use  
  The script allows you to just mash enter to get you a correctly set up
  project for a library, which can be built as either static or shared.
  You want a project with an executable? Just choose `e` when prompted.
  Header-only library? Just choose `h` when prompted. Simple **and** correct!
* Create [`FetchContent`][1] ready projects  
  This is important, because in the near feature this might allow CMake to
  consume other projects in a trivial fashion similar to other languages, e.g.
  in JavaScript's case (npm).
* Cleanly separate developer and consumer targets  
  This ties into the previous point as well, but developers and consumers of a
  project have different needs, and separating targets achieves that goal. A
  developer should be able to run tests, add warning flags, run benchmarks,
  etc., while a consumer, such as a package maintainer, generally only wants to
  build the library or the executable itself, without having to patch around in
  the CMake scripts. Show some love to your package maintainers!
* Use modern CMake (3.14+)  
  There are too many outdated and plain wrong examples on the internet, it's
  time to change that.

## Non-goals

* Cover every possible project structure  
  Doing this is pointless as an init script, because there are far too many
  ways people have been building software, and if you have special needs, you
  ought to already know CMake and you can set the project up yourself.
* Generate files and show tips for websites other than GitHub  
  While I understand the people who are against GitHub (and by proxy
  Microsoft), it's by far the most used website of its kind, the files and
  messages specific to it are small in number, and they are easily adapted for
  any other service.

## Install

Make sure you have these programs installed:

* Python 3.8 or newer
* CMake 3.19 or newer
* git

`cmake-init` consists of a single file that can be run using Python. Python was
chosen for this, because it is cross-platform, convenient for this use-case and
you likely already have it installed or the need for it will come up later
anyway.

You have to just download the `cmake-init.pyz` script from the [releases][4],
place it somewhere in your `PATH` and rename it to `cmake-init`. On Windows,
you have to create a `cmake-init.bat` file to proxy to the script:

```batch
@echo off

python cmake-init.pyz %*
```

## Usage

* `cmake-init create <path>`  
  This command will create a CMake project at the provided location and
  according to the answers given to the prompts. You may pass the `-s`, `-e` or
  `-ho` flags after `create` to quickly create a shared library, executable or
  a header only library respectively.
* `cmake-init -h`  
  Shows the help screen.

## To-do

* Maybe figure out PEX  
  It would be nicer if the big chunks of strings could be packaged in a
  runnable zip, so the script itself stays simple.
